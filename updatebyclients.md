Developer Notes for "Cool Factor"
Cursor: Implement a custom circular cursor. When hovering over the Price Cards or Buttons, the cursor should scale up 1.5x and turn transparent blue.

Scroll Animation: Use framer-motion. As the user scrolls down, the Pricing Cards should "Fade Up" and "Scale In" slightly.

Sticky Button (Mobile): On mobile devices, keep a "Book Now" button fixed at the bottom of the screen so it's always accessible.
